You may find the video demo video:

Please note, this software is technically a module of Prosody XMPP server. In other wordes, it is of a server function. The video demo shows actually client experience or usage case.

## LIVE demo
Sorry, to save cost, I closed my live demo server.

## Usage
You may treate this module as a special MUC of XMPP. And use it as MUC. But when you chat with an account, such as sales@xmpp.org, technically you and the account are in a dynamically created MUC, which is only accessible to you and the target account.

LIVE Help/ Support is kind of usage case.
