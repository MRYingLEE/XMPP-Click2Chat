# XMPP-RoleChat

## Video Demo

You may find the video demo at:
https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PL3RLIfS0Rx-7wtOzVY2LHbG6cN_uolDub

Please note, this software is technically a module of Prosody XMPP server. In other wordes, it is of a server function. The video demo shows actually client experience or usage case.

## LIVE demo
Sorry, to save cost, I closed my live demo server.

## Usage
You may treat this module as a special MUC of XMPP and use it as MUC. But when you chat with an account, such as sales@role.xmpp.org, technically you and the role are in a dynamically created MUC, which is only accessible to you and the target role. BTW, a few people can play the same role.

LIVE Help/ Support is kind of usage case.


## Version
I developed the module on Prosody 0.9.9. This module should work on recent versions also.

## Pending Patent
I have a pending patent on role based chat. This module uses the pending patent.
For all-non-profit usage, I won't charge you, but please let me know your usage.

## Other license
If you want other license instead of GNU, please contact me.
