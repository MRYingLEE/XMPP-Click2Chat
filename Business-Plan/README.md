Here is the business plan to launch this software as a business.

At the beginning, I tried to target consumer. The market is huge, but also overcrowded due to a lot of big players.

Then for a long time, I tried to target business market. The market is composed of a lot of niche markets. 

I failed to get found after I contacted 20s investors.

Maybe someone can target on consumer market again.
